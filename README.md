Shortcuts I created to make life easier on iPhones and iPads.

## Save Article
When selected from your Share Sheet, this shortcut will copy the contents of the current webpage into a new Note in a folder called "Articles" in your Notes app. This helps to archive interesting content online that might be removed in the future, making it easily searchable in the Notes app.

### To use:
1. Create a Folder titled "Articles" in your Notes app
2. "Edit Actions" in your Share Sheet to put this shortcut in a convenient location
